# Project Car Price Prediction on DVM-Car dataset

## 🎯 Introduction

Welcome to the **Car Price Prediction** project! The goal is to predict car prices as accurately as possible using machine learning models. These models are trained on the renowned **DVM-Car Dataset**, which comprises over 250,000+ car samples and advertisements.

This repository contains the core components of the project, including:
- **Machine Learning Models (3):** Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, and XGBoost.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) file.**
- **Preprocessing Pipeline**


## ✨ Features

* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Provides charts and statistics offering deep insights into the car dataset.
* **Machine Learning Models:** Utilizes various ML models to train and build accurate car price prediction models.
* **Prediction API:** A RESTful API built with FastAPI for integrating car price predictions into other applications.
* **Web Interface:** A simple web application allowing users to input car information and receive instant price predictions.
* **Containerization (Docker):** Ensures easy deployment across different platforms.
